##TDD
What is TDD? Rules of TDD etc. incomplete


## Common Files
`weather.csv` has all the records required for parsing.
`weatherTest.csv` has one record line used for testing file input.

## Java Blueprint

In the `Java` folder you'll find `TDD.java` and `TDDTest.java` with `getDataFromFile` function implemented. 

## Python Blueprint

In the `Python` folder, you'll find `tdd.py` and `test_tdd.py`. 
You will need to develop tests in test_tdd.py first, and then develop corresponding functions in `tdd.py`.
